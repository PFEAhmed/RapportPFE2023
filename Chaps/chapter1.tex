\section{Working methodology and modeling language}
\subsection{Traditional work methodology vs Agile method }
In order to ensure a successful outcome for an IT project, it is crucial to follow a structured work methodology throughout its entire lifecycle. A work methodology provides a framework for project management, which includes defining tasks, assigning responsibilities, monitoring progress, and ensuring that deadlines are met.\cite{PGC10}


\vspace{0.25cm}
There are many different methodologies that can be used for IT project management, such as Agile\cite{Aw15} and Heavyweight\cite{Aw15} . Each methodology has its own set of principles, practices, and tools that are designed to optimize project performance and efficiency.

\subsection{Chosen methodology: SCRUM}

        \caption{Scrum process}
        \label{fig:Scrum process}
    \end{figure}
\FloatBarrier
   
\subsubsection{Reasons}
The adopted development methodology is Scrum. The choice is based on Scrum's strengths, which can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Flexibility} : Scrum is designed to be flexible and adaptable to changing project requirements. This allows teams to respond quickly to changes in the project environment.\cite{Aw15}\cite{PGC10}

\item \textbf{Collaboration}: Scrum emphasizes collaboration and communication between team members. \cite{Aw15}\cite{PGC10}

\item \textbf{Continuous Improvement} : Scrum includes regular reviews and retrospectives, which provide opportunities for the team to reflect on their progress and identify areas for improvement.\cite{Aw15}\cite{PGC10}

\item \textbf{Transparency} : Scrum provides a framework for making project progress and status visible to all stakeholders.\cite{Aw15}\cite{PGC10}

\item \textbf{Empowerment}: Scrum encourages team members to take ownership of their work and make decisions independently.\cite{Aw15}\cite{PGC10}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{The Scrum team}
And we can not end this section without talking about the scrum team  which is composed of:
\begin{itemize}

\item The \textbf{Scrum Master} is responsible for implementing and maximizing the benefits of the Scrum process. They facilitate Scrum events, remove obstacles, and promote continuous improvement.\cite{PGC10}
\item The \textbf{team} is a cross-functional group of self-motivated individuals who share tasks and responsibilities, working collaboratively to manage themselves and deliver successful product increments every Sprint.\cite{PGC10}
\item The \textbf{Product Owner} is typically the project's key stakeholder, who has a deep understanding of users, the marketplace, competitors, and trends. They are responsible for managing the Product Backlog to maximize the project's value and representing the interests of everyone with a stake in the project and its resulting product.\cite{PGC10}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Other terminologies}
Let's now look at some options specific to the agile mode and more particularly to SCRUM.
\begin{itemize}
\item A \textbf{sprint} is a time-boxed period when a SCRUM team works to complete a set amount of work in one repeating cycle, typically lasting no longer than one month and fixed throughout the overall work.\cite{PGC10}
\item The \textbf{Product Backlog}   in SCRUM is a prioritized list of items (or user stories) that represent work needed to deliver a product or service, including estimated completion times. It changes with business conditions or technology.\cite{PGC10}
\item Th\textbf{User stories} are often used to describe the Product Backlog items in terms of their value to the end user of the product.\cite{PGC10}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Modeling languages : UML and SysMl}
\subsubsection{UML}

\textbf{UML} , or Unified Modeling Language, is a standardized visual language for describing software systems composed of a set of diagrams, each of which provides a different view of the project to be addressed.\cite{HMB03}

\textbf{UML}  provides us with diagrams to represent the system to be developed: its operation, startup, actions that can be performed by the system, etc. Creating these diagrams is therefore equivalent to modeling the needs of the software to be developed.\cite{HMB03}

\begin{itemize}
\item Structure diagrams 
\begin{itemize}
\item Class Diagram
\item Component Diagram
\item Deployment Diagram
\item Object Diagram
\item Package Diagram
\item Profile Diagram
\item Composite Structure Diagram
\end{itemize}
\item Behavioral Diagrams
\begin{itemize}
\item Use Case Diagram
\item Activity Diagram
\item State Machine Diagram
\item Sequence Diagram
\item Communication Diagram
\item Interaction Overview Diagram
\item Timing Diagram
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{SysMl}
\textbf{SysMl},  or Systems Modeling Language, is a graphical language used by MBSE (Model-Based Systems Engineering) practitioners to create system models and communicate ideas about system designs to stakeholders. It is a language that has a grammar and vocabulary consisting of graphical notations that have specific meanings. The purpose of SysML is to visualize and communicate a system's design among stakeholders.\cite{LD13}

The grammar and notations of SysML are defined in a standards specification published by the Object Management Group, which is a consortium of computer industry companies, government agencies, and academic institutions. SysML is an extension of a subset of the Unified Modeling Language (UML), and its complete definition requires referring to parts of the UML specification document as well.\cite{LD13}
\begin{itemize}
\item Behavior diagrams\cite{LD13}
\begin{itemize}
\item Activity diagram
\item State machine diagram
\item Sequence diagram
\item Use case diagram
\item Communication diagram
\end{itemize}
\item Structure diagrams\cite{LD13}
\begin{itemize}
\item Block definition diagram
\item Internal block diagram
\item Parametric diagram
\item Package diagram
\item Composite structure diagram
\end{itemize}
\item Requirement diagram\cite{LD13}
