\chapter{Sprint Two: Raspberry pi 4 and ESP32 Cam Integration for Logo Detection}
\section*{Introduction}
\section{Specification of requirements}
In this section, we introduce the different actors as well as the functional and non-functional requirements.
\subsection{actors identification }
\subsection{Description of functional requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item The ESP32-CAM board should be able to capture a live stream of pictures or videos and make them available through its built-in server.
\item The raspberry pi should be able to connect to the server on the ESP32-CAM board and retrieve the images or videos.
\item The raspberry pi should be able to process the images to determine if a specific logo is present or not.
\item The raspberry pi should be able to process the images to determine if a specific logo is flipped on the x axis.
\item The raspberry pi should be able to process the images to determine if a specific logo is in the first or the second half of the product.
\item The raspberry pi should be able to provide some form of feedback or output indicating whether the logo is present and if it is flipped or not.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Description of non-functional requirements}
The requirements do not stop at the functional level but tend towards requirements that contribute to better quality of the application. The most important ones are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Reliability:} The system should be able to consistently capture and process images accurately.
\item \textbf{Performance:} The system should be able to process images quickly and without noticeable lag or delay.
\item \textbf{Security:} The system should have appropriate security measures in place to prevent unauthorized access to the servers and data.
\item \textbf{Scalability:} The system should be able to handle multiple simultaneous connections and requests from clients without compromising its performance.
\item \textbf{Maintainability:} The system should be easy to maintain and update, with clear and well-documented code and configuration.
\item \textbf{Compatibility:} The system should be compatible with a wide range of devices and platforms.
\item \textbf{Usability:} The system should be easy to use and understand for both technical and non-technical users.
\end{itemize}
