Tesca is a factory that utilizes an object recognition sensor called IFM O2D220 to detect potential defects in logos present on its products. The IFM O2D220 employs two types of sensors: the Contour Sensor and the Pixel Counter.

The Contour Sensor is designed to quickly analyze and compare the defined shape of an object with similar objects. It is particularly useful when the shape of the inspected objects is repetitive. The sensor uses incident light or backlight to detect the contours of an object and then compares them with contours from reference images. Based on the level of conformity, the sensor generates an output indicating the presence of a model and, if applicable, identifies the specific model found.\cite{Tnd}

The Pixel Counter sensor analyzes the area of an object by counting the pixels. This sensor is best suited for inspecting objects that vary in terms of shape, size, or shade. It also utilizes incident light or backlight to detect object contours. By comparing the pixel count with predetermined thresholds, the sensor determines the characteristics and features of the object.\cite{Tnd}

To elaborate further, let's examine a couple of examples of the ifm object recognition sensor in action:

Identify missing piece in O-ring assembly :  as you can see in figure \ref{fig:exp1}, identifying that a piece is missingin an O-ring is imperative. The Pixel Counter is programmed to verify that the O-ring is complete and that no piece is missing regardless of the size and location of the missing piece. \cite{Tnd}

\FloatBarrier


In the factory's workflow, workers are responsible for placing the individual pieces of the product into designated placeholders along the assembly line seen in figure \ref{fig:place holder} . Once the piece is securely positioned, the system relies on the ifm object recognition sensor to assess its quality.
The ifm sensor analyzes the piece, evaluating its characteristics and comparing them to predetermined quality criteria. If the piece meets the required standards and is determined to be good, the system triggers an automated mechanism associated with the placeholder. As a result, the placeholder smoothly lowers its position, indicating that the piece has been approved and can proceed to the next stage of production. the problem here is that When selecting the operating distance it has to be taken into account that contour detection becomes less reliable with decreasing size of the objects. The objects to
be detected should cover at least 5\% of the field of view
The requirement for objects to cover a certain percentage of the field of view indicates that the existing system may struggle to detect smaller objects reliably. This can result in potential issues such as false positives or missed detections, leading to a decrease in overall efficiency and quality control.

Another issue that may arise with product placement is that this soltion is based on preconfigured rules. In the given example, if we focus on Figure \ref{fig:exp2}, it is apparent that if the normal can were to be placesd slitly above  , it would mistakenly be detected as a defective piece because the the putline of the cap will be above the preconfigured outline.

The reliance on fixed rules poses a challenge when dealing with variations in product placement that fall within acceptable tolerances. In cases where slight deviations occur, such as minor misalignments or positioning errors, the system may incorrectly classify the product as defective, leading to unnecessary interruptions in the production process.

As a result, this limitation can lead to false detection of defects and potentially disrupt the production line. It highlights the importance of considering alternative or supplementary methods for accurately assessing the presence of the cap.

\subsection{Solution}
To address the limitations and challenges associated with the existing contour detection system, I propose an alternative solution that leverages the power of the YOLOv5 object detection.
By integrating a system based on YOLOv5, we can overcome the drawbacks of the current approach and enhance our ability to detect defective logos on the production line. The improved accuracy of YOLOv5 ensures more precise identification and localization of logos, reducing the chances of false positives or missed detections. This is especially valuable when dealing with logos of varying sizes, shapes, and orientations.

\subsection{Modeling languages : SysMl}
\textbf{SysMl},  or Systems Modeling Language, is a graphical language used by MBSE (Model-Based Systems Engineering) practitioners to create system models and communicate ideas about system designs to stakeholders. It is a language that has a grammar and vocabulary consisting of graphical notations that have specific meanings. The purpose of SysML is to visualize and communicate a system's design among stakeholders.\cite{LD13}

The grammar and notations of SysML are defined in a standards specification published by the Object Management Group, which is a consortium of computer industry companies, government agencies, and academic institutions. SysML is an extension of a subset of the Unified Modeling Language (UML), and its complete definition requires referring to parts of the UML specification document as well.\cite{LD13}
We can name a few types of SysMl diagrams:
\begin{itemize}
\item Behavior diagrams\cite{LD13}
\begin{itemize}
\item Activity diagram
\item State machine diagram
\item Sequence diagram
\item Use case diagram
\item Communication diagram
\end{itemize}
\item Structure diagrams\cite{LD13}
\begin{itemize}
\item Block definition diagram
\item Internal block diagram
\item Parametric diagram
\item Package diagram
\item Composite structure diagram
\end{itemize}
\item Requirement diagram\cite{LD13}
\end{itemize}
